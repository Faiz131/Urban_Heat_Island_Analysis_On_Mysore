#  Urban Heat Island (UHI) Analysis of Mysore  
This project explores the **Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect** in Mysore using **Google Earth Engine (GEE) & QGIS**. The goal is to understand how urbanization influences **land surface temperature (LST)** through remote sensing and geospatial analysis.  

##  Project Overview  
- **LST Calculation**: Estimating land surface temperature using remote sensing data.  
- **NDVI Analysis**: Assessing vegetation cover to study its cooling effect.  
- **NDBI Analysis**: Evaluating built-up areas and their contribution to heat intensity.  
- **Regression Analysis**: Understanding correlations between urbanization and temperature variations.  

##  Tools & Technologies  
- **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** for satellite image processing  
- **QGIS** for spatial data visualization  
- **JavaScript & Python** for data analysis and regression modeling  

##  Key Findings  
- Higher **NDVI (green cover)** leads to **lower temperatures**, confirming the cooling effect of vegetation.  
- Increased **NDBI (built-up areas)** correlates with **higher temperatures**, highlighting the Urban Heat Island effect.  
- Regression analysis confirms a strong relationship between urbanization and temperature variations.
